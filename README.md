✍️ Description
This web is cloned from W3.CSS Templates and I improvised it a bit

[Click here](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm) 👈 to see the original template

And [Click here]([url](https://nickelodeanuzumaki.github.io/clone-and-improvised-w3s-template/)) 👈 to see the results that I have learned when did the web (I haven't fix the error to appear the CSS and responsive)

The purpose of doing this web is to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web Responsive

**Note:**

index.html - the html file
hehe.css - the style.css
responsive.css- for css for responsive
