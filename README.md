# clone-and-improvised-w3s-template

✍️ Description

This web is cloned from W3.CSS Templates and I improvised it a bit

[Click here](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_band.htm) 👈 to see the original template

And [Click here](https://nickelodeanuzumaki.github.io/clone-and-improvised-w3s-template/) 👈 to see the results that I have learned when I did the web (I haven't fix the error to appear the CSS and responsive)

The purpose of doing this web is to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Web Responsive

**Note:**

index.html - the html file

hehe.css - the style.css

responsive.css- for css for responsive
